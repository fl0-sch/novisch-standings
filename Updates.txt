	BÖÖL to BUG (summer 2020)

idk what to write here. stuff i changed so i know what to chcange back if it all fucks up:
 - changed the size of the FU photo/logo so its not so fuckign massive (for my small laptop screen)
   this was done in the line 'logo = logo.resize((435,438),Image.ANTIALIAS)'
 - for some reason quests had decimals in list.html and on webiste so changed quest_list.csv
   to have integers instead of general in formatting for quest_number.
 - change the multiple quest add-on from repetition=" (Can be done multiple times by all teams!)" to repetition= "  ∞".
 - changed the name of the website to lundsnaturvetarkar.se/quests ! no more experiments ! 
 - changed the website a lot. made a rule doc. Changes can be seen in the wordpress history.
 - changed float to int for quest_number in line 335 so no decimals in quest number on website! it kept coming back
 - Discovered the upload password doesnt work. you can type anything and it accepts.
